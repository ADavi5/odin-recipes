        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven for 375 F (190 C).</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice the eggplant, 
                tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately 1/18-inch
                 (1-mm)-thick rounds, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) 
                oven-safe pan over medium-hgih heat. Saute the onion, 
                garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. 
                Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes.
                 Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove 
                 from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth 
                 the surface of the sauce with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Arrange the veggies in alternation slices, (for example, eggplant, 
                tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce, working from the o
                uter edge to the center of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, 
                garlic, parsely, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb 
                seasoning over the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then 
                bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Serve hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also 
                excellent the next day-cover with foil and reheat in a 350 F oven 
                for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
