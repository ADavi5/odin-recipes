        <p>An upgrade to your classic brownies with brown butter. 
            These are dense, fudgy, and loaded with chocolate!</p>
        <p>This recipe uses a mix of cocoa powder AND melted chocolate to 
            creat the perfect chocolately dessert.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 tablespoons (150g) unsalted butter, cut into 10 slices
            </li>
            <li>6 ounces (170g) chopped semi-sweet chocolate, good 
                quality
            </li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) packed brown sugar, light or dark</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (40g) unsweeeted cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (60g) all-purpose flour, spoon and leveled</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup (170g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks</li>
            <li>flaky sea salt (optional - for topping)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350Â°F. Grease and line an 8x8 inch 
                baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a bit of paper 
                hanging over the sides to make it easier to pull the baked
                 brownies out. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepot, add butter slices and place onto a stove 
                burner set to medium heat. Heat, stirring frequently, until 
                the butter melts and turns a little goden brown. It will foam
                 quite a bit, but it should settle down once the butter is 
                 ready to take off the heat. This will take about 5 to 8 
                 minutes from start to finish
            </li>
            <li>Working relatively quickly so the butter doesn't continue 
                browningfrom the residual heat in the pan, whisk in chopped 
                chocolate until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool slightly
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine both sugars and eggs. Using an 
                electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment or a whisk
                 by hand (it <em>is</em> a workout though!) whisk together
                  sugars and eggs until the sugar is dissolved. This will 
                  take around 5 to 7 minutes. To test if it's ready, rub 
                  some of the mixture between your fingers. It shouldn't 
                  feel grainy.</li>
            <li>Add your vanilla, cocoa, and slightly cooled brown butter 
                mixture to the egg mis. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add flour, salt, and chocolate chips to the wet ingredients. 
                Mix together until <em>just</em> combined. Take care not to 
                overmix!</li>
            <li>Pour your batter into the prepared bakng pan. Bake in the 
                center of your preheated oven for 25 to 40 minutes, or 
                until the top is no longer shiny and a skewer inserted 
                into the center comes out with moist crumbs.</li>
            <li>Cool completely in the pan. Once cool, use the overhanging
                parchment paper to pull the brownies out and cut into 16 
                slices. (Optional) sprinkle some flaky sea salt on top before serving!
            </li>
