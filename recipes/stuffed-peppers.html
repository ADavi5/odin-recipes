        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound 90% lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>Heaping 1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3 large, red, yellow, or orange bell peppers, cut in
                half from the stem to the bottom and cored
            </li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried pregano</li>
            <li>1 (8-oz can) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 F and set an oven rack in the middle 
                position</li>
            <li>Tenderize the beef: In a medium bowl, using your hands, mash the 
                beef with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the baking soda. Let sit for 
                20 minutes while you continue with the recipe.</li>
            <li>Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil for easy clean-up. 
                Place the peppers, cut side up, in the baking dish; drizzle with 1 
                tablespoon of the oiland sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon 
                salt.</li>
            <li>Roas the peppers for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned and 
                tender-crsip. A bit of liquid will accumulate in the bottom of the 
            peppers; that's okay.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over 
                medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook, 
                stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more; do no brown. Add the ground 
                beef mixture, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and increase the 
                heat to medium high. Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon,
                 until the meat is browned and almost cooked through;4 to 5 minutes. 
                 Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium 
                 low and cook, uncovered, until the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
                  Add the cooked rice and 3/4 cup of the cheese, and stir until melted. 
                  Remove the skillet from the heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the peppers from the oven and spoon the meat filling evenly 
                into the peppers. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup cheese and place 
                back in the oven. Roast for 10 to 15 minute, until the filling is hot 
                and the cheese is melted and bubbling, and serve.</li>
